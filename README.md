# databricks-pyspark-pipeline
WIP - Building a whole pipeline while organizing the data on a medallion architecture
<br>
I'm working on this in my spare time using Community Databricks, so it's far from finished, pretty rough around the edges, and a little limited in features. Keep that in mind.
<br>
I got the data and the basics from the Databricks Academy: Advanced Data Engineering course.
<br>
I aim to put my years of experience into this project and make it as close as possible to real everyday work.
<br>
While doing this, I also deepen my knowledge and delve further into the PySpark and Databricks documentation.
