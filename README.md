# Developing with Databricks: From Ingestion to Transformation in a Multi-Hop Environment

Using two notebooks (01_Ingestion and 02_Transformation), my goal is to simulate a development environment with a multi-hop/medallion architecture (see image below). To achieve this, I'm implementing Auto-loader and Structured Streaming.<br>
The data and base idea are derived from the Databricks Academy's Advanced Data Engineering with Databricks course.<br>
The entire pipeline was developed using the community version of Databricks, so I primarily worked within a workspace with basic permissions.<br>
